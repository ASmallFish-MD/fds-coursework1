You are free to form study groups and discuss the concepts related to, and the high-level approach to the coursework. **You may never share code or share write-ups**. It is also not permitted to discuss this coursework on Piazza. The only exception is that if you believe there is an error in the coursework, you may ask a private question to the instructors, and if we feel that the issue is justified, we will send out an announcement.\n",

    "- For answers involving figures, make sure to clearly label your plots and provide legends where necessary. You will gain marks for clear visualizations. \n",

    "Your submission should be in the form of a Jupyter notebook including your code, the visualizations you created for each question, and your analysis. The notebook will read the given data and generate the requested visualizations - it is not necessary to show the exploration of the data.  Please submit the notebook in three formats: ipynb, html, and pdf.  \n",
